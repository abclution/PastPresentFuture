In the inception of our tale, the stage was set with the existence of Fiat currencies, colloquially known as "Money by Decree." Near worthless value metal coins & paper, serving as mere symbols of wealth and value, mandated for use by the populace in their everyday transactions.

For those who grasped the profound realities surrounding Fiat currencies, they wisely allocated their wealth into tangible assets such as land and precious metals like gold. Yet, the inconvenience of lugging around sacks of gold ranged from bothersome when purchasing a simple coffee to utterly impractical when buying from Amazon or paying for Netflix subscriptions.

It became evident that a slew of issues plagued these Fiat-based economies. From the deliberate and planned inflation embedded within Fiat systems to the blatant manipulation of the money supply, the common individual found themselves grappling with a profound lack of trust in the very currency they relied upon. Wave after wave of recession, and even full-blown economic collapses in the dominion of centralized Fiat currencies, left the ordinary person at the mercy of the whims of irresponsible bankers and fraudulent governments. 

Nonetheless, amidst this quagmire of doubt and inconvenience, there remained no alternative that could be deemed both trustworthy and practical.
