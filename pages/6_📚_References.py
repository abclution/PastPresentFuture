## Security Budget

The term **"Security Budget"** typically refers to the resources and mechanisms allocated and spent to secure the Bitcoin network.

It can be assessed in the simple economic terms of :green[Income] vs :red[Expenditures].

### :green[Income Items]
- ðŸ’° Block Reward, a reward of newly mined Bitcoin given to the winning miner, per block.
- ðŸ¤‘ Transaction Fees, users of Bitcoin pay a fee to send transactions.


### :red[Expenditures Items]
- ðŸ”Œ Electricity Cost
    - the cost of running Bitcoin mining hardware.
- ðŸ–§ Hardware Purchases & Failures
    - ex. Bitcoin Mining Equipment, Air Conditioners, Wiring etc.
- ðŸ’¸ Rent, taxes, licenses, salaries and other wages for the running of the Bitcoin mining operation.

In this presentation from the Expenditures items, we will only focus on the Electricity Cost, as it is the majority costs of any Bitcoin Mining operation.


### :red[Simply put, if the cost of the Expenditures is greater than the Income, the Miners are running at a loss & not making a profit.]
