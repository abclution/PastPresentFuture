    ## Security Budget

    The term **"Security Budget"** typically refers to the resources and mechanisms allocated and spent to secure the Bitcoin network.

    It can be assessed in the simple economic terms of :green[Income] vs :red[Expenditures].

    ### :green[Income Items]
    - ðŸ’° Block Reward, a reward of newly mined Bitcoin given to the winning miner, per block.
    - ðŸ¤‘ Transaction Fees, users of Bitcoin pay a fee to send transactions.


    ### :red[Expenditures Items]
    - ðŸ”Œ Electricity Cost - the cost of running Bitcoin mining and associated hardware. *
    - ðŸ–§ Hardware Purchases & Failures - ex. Bitcoin Mining Equipment, Air Conditioners, Wiring etc.
    - ðŸ’¸ Rent, taxes, licenses, salaries and other wages for the running of the Bitcoin mining operation.

    ---
    - *In this presentation we will only consider "ðŸ”Œ Electricity Cost" from the :red[Expenditures Items], as it is the majority costs of Bitcoin Mining operations. 
    
    - We will however consider all :green[Income Items] in the comparisons.


    ### :red[Simply put, if the cost of the Expenditures is greater than the Income, the Miners are running at a loss & not making a profit.]
